# Interactive Biodiversity Dashboard

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to build an interactive dashboard using event handlers in JavaScript and Plotly.js to create graphs, such as bubble graphs and bar graphs. The finished product is deployed to GitHub Pages.

## Software

The only software that I used to create this dashboard is [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). However, any code editor that supports the following can be used:
  - HTML
  - JavaScript
  - D3.js
  - Plotly.js
  - CSS
  - Bootstrap
